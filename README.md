# Building Escape

First-person exploratory experience with a hint of puzzle solving elements; implemented player interaction and environmental obstacle components through Unrealâ€™s C++ API.

# Disclaimer
Due to large asset files, this project has 2 branches: demo and full branch. This is the demo branch that displays the main functionality of the game's components. Screenshots will be provided on the full level design...
